A small game based on the game doodle jump, made with a timelimit of one week. 
The game follows several rules and design guidelines given before the start of development. 

As a basis for the game a very simple framework was provided that allowed for loading and rendering of sprites at a given screen position as well as basic input events.
All remaining gameplay elements and mechanics were coded from scratch.
Due to licensing/copyright the framework and the associated classes were omitted from this upload.
